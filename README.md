This project can be used to register issues with current published MEDIN guidelines, and to register requests for new guidelines to be created by MEDIN or drafted externally and adopted by MEDIN. Please use the Issues to log a new idea.

Please see the [MEDIN Guidelines webpage](https://medin.org.uk/data-standards/medin-data-guidelines) for the full list of current MEDIN guidelines.
