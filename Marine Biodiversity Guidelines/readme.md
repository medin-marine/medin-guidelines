## Background to Data Guidelines

The Marine Environmental Data and Information Network (MEDIN) are working towards creating a
framework of consistent guidelines covering the major types of data collection undertaken in the
marine environment around the UK. The principal benefits of this suite of guidelines are:
- Allowing contracting organisation(s) to easily specify a format that data should be
returned in that can be readily used and includes all relevant attributes
- Provides a consistent format for contractors to work to (rather than a different format
for each contract)
- Data can be readily exported to Data Archiving Centres and other users
- Instils good practice amongst users

Each guideline defines the data and information that must be stored with a particular data type to
ensure it can be readily used and reused. As this type of information is specific for different data types,
guidelines are developed for each type.

## Using this Data Guideline
The data guideline is split into three sections:

### General Metadata

The General Metadata tables are common to all Data Guidelines and so only need to be completed
once for a survey even if a number of different techniques and data guidelines are used.

**Survey** - a uniquely identifiable programme of data collection such as a research cruise, moored
instrument deployment or survey event
**Project** - a collection of surveys that have been completed for a common purpose

### Detailed Metadata

The detailed metadata are specific to a technique of data collection (e.g. trawl, grab etc.) and are
subsequently specific to each Data Guideline.

**Acquisition Method** (Data Production Tools) – details of any method or instruments used to collect
the data

### Data

The tables are specific to the data being collected, and will hold a combination of data and/or
metadata required to ensure their re-use. 

These contain fields that need to be populated to allow the supplied data to be re-used effectively.
Each field is either; mandatory, conditional or optional as indicated by M, C, or O respectively.
Conditional means that the field must be completed if a value is known.

In the event that historical data which do not have all the necessary mandatory fields are being
configured into this guideline, then it is permissible to use the following entry terms:
- **unknown** - The correct value is not known to and not computable by the creator of this information. However a correct value probably exists.
- **inapplicable** - There is no appropriate value. To be used in cases where metadata elements cannot
be set null due to schema constraints.

In some cases it may be necessary to extend this guideline for a specific purpose such as a specific 
exchange of data between applications or to fulfil the needs of a specific project. This is permissible,
however MEDIN advise that the broad structure and format is maintained and that where possible
controlled vocabularies are used. As any extension to the structure and format may be useful for other
organisations please inform MEDIN of further agreements.

## Controlled Vocabularies
MEDIN makes use of controlled vocabularies (sometimes called “Term Lists”) to ensure that
information provided alongside data is unambiguous. The available catalogues of controlled
vocabularies used for this MEDIN data guideline are provided primarily by the [UK Natural Environment
Research Council (NERC)](https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/search_nvs/), the [International Council for the Sea (ICES)](http://vocab.ices.dk/) and the [European Petroleum
Survey Group (EPSG)](https://epsg.org/home.html). If a term is not available in a recommended list then please contact MEDIN to
arrange for the term to be added.
